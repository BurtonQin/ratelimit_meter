///
/// While algorithms like leaky-bucket rate limiters allow cells to be
/// distributed across time in any way, GCRA is a rate-limiting *and*
/// traffic-shaping algorithm. It mandates that a minimum amount of
/// time passes between cells being measured. For example, if your API
/// mandates that only 20 requests can be made per second, GCRA will
/// ensure that each request is at least 50ms apart from the previous
/// request. This makes GCRA suitable for shaping traffic in
/// networking and telecom equipment (it was initially made for
/// asynchronous transfer mode networks), or for outgoing workloads on
/// *consumers* of attention, e.g. distributing outgoing emails across
/// a day.
///
/// # A note about batch decisions
/// In a blatant side-stepping of the above traffic-shaping criteria,
/// this implementation of GCRA comes with an extension that allows
/// measuring multiple cells at once, assuming that if a pause of
/// `n*(the minimum time between cells)` has passed, we can allow a
/// single big batch of `n` cells through. This assumption may not be
/// correct for your application, but if you depend on GCRA's
/// traffic-shaping properties, it's better to not use the `_n`
/// suffixed check functions.
///
/// # Example
/// In this example, we construct a rate-limiter with the GCR
/// algorithm that can accommodate 20 cells per second. This translates
/// to the GCRA parameters Ï„=1s, T=50ms (that's 1s / 20 cells).
///
/// ```
/// # use ratelimit_meter::{DirectRateLimiter, GCRA};
/// # use std::num::NonZeroU32;
/// # use std::time::{Instant, Duration};
/// let mut limiter = DirectRateLimiter::<GCRA>::per_second(NonZeroU32::new(20).unwrap());
/// let now = Instant::now();
/// let ms = Duration::from_millis(1);
/// assert_eq!(Ok(()), limiter.check_at(now)); // the first cell is free
/// for i in 0..20 {
///     // Spam a lot:
///     assert!(limiter.check_at(now).is_ok(), "at {}", i);
/// }
/// // We have exceeded the bucket capacity:
/// assert!(limiter.check_at(now).is_err());
///
/// // After a sufficient time period, cells are allowed again:
